### Project Motivation
It is well known that exposure to certain chemicals can be a causal factor for many cancers, and many of the chemicals released from industry are carcinogenic. For this project, we wanted to know if we could use datasets that are publicly available to see if there is a geographic association between incidences of cancer and amount of toxic waste dumping. We hope our project results can help people understand the importance of reducing the amount of toxic waste dumping and create a cleaner, healthier living environment. 


### Data Sources
[**The Toxic Releases Inventory (TRI)**](https://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov/toxmap/download.html) is a dataset compiled by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and contains comprehensive information describing estimated waste release and transfers of toxic chemicals in the United States between 1987 to present. Following policy passed in 1986, it became required for manufacturing facilities to report their releases of toxic chemicals to the EPA. By making these data public, industries are held accountable for their waste and environmental impact. 

[**The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program**](https://seer.cancer.gov/data/) is a dataset compiled by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and contains information that describes cancer statistics in the United States. They compile information from 17 cancer registries across ten states from 1987 to 2009.  We extracted the number of new cancer cases down by county level and used census population data to calculate the cancer incidence per year by county.
